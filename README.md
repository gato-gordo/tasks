Tasks
=====

This is a basic to-do app.  It  is intended to be used to teach people how to
make a functioning web application using jQuery event handlers and DOM
manipulation. It also uses local storage to implement persistence.

Each commit represents an incremental Step (7 total) in development that is a natural
checkpoint for students.  To use this app in a class:

  1.  Checkout each commit corresponding to Steps 1-7.  
  2.  Show the app at each Step in the browser.
  3.  Have students try to implement that Step in code.
  4.  Go over source code for each Step and explain how it works.

Provide links to documentation or hints as needed (a set of such links and hints
corresponding to each Step is included below).
